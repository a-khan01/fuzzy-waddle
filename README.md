Chatbot for Microsoft Teams
This project contains a simple chatbot interface that can be integrated with Microsoft Teams using the Direct Line API. The interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it allows users to send and receive messages through the Microsoft Teams platform.

Getting Started
To use this chatbot interface, you will need to have a Microsoft Teams account and a Direct Line secret key. The Direct Line secret key can be obtained by creating a new Direct Line channel in the Microsoft Bot Framework portal.

Once you have your Direct Line secret key, you can update the index.html file in the chatbot_site folder with your secret key, and deploy the folder to a web hosting service like Netlify.

Usage
To use the chatbot interface, simply open the URL where you have deployed the chatbot_site folder, and start sending messages. The interface will send your messages to the Direct Line API, which will then forward them to your Microsoft Teams account. Likewise, any messages sent to your Microsoft Teams account will be displayed in the chatbot interface.
